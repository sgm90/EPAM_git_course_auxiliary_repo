[Narrative 1]
In the sheltering shade of the forest
Calling calming silence
Accompanied only by the full moon
The howling of a night wolf
And the path under my bare feet
The Elvenpath

[Verse 1: Tarja]
Hearing music from the deepest forest
Songs as a seduction of sirens
The elf-folk is calling me

[Verse 2: Tarja]
Tapio, Bear-king, Ruler of the forest
Mielikki, Bluecloak, Healer of the ill and sad
Open the gate and let me follow the uncurving path

[Hook: Tarja]
The way to the lands
Where as a hero I stand
The path where Beauty met the Beast
Elvenpath
It's the honesty of these worlds
Ruled by magic and mighty swords
That makes my soul long for the past
Elvenpath
